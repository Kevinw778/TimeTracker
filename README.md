Time Tracker program made to keep track of when an individual should leave
for the day, if following a 40-hour, 8 hours a day schedule.

Planning on making it so the user can simply have a text file or some kind
of setup dialog that can adjust how many hours they plan to work each day
or per week, then make the necessary calculations off of that information,
instead of using a text file or hard-coded values.
