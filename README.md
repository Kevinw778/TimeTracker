# Time Tracker

Time Tracker program made to keep track of when an individual should leave
for the day, if following a 40-hour, 8 hours a day schedule.

## Future Dev
- [x] Finally commit TimeTracker code to my Github
- [ ] Create dialog to change hours/day / hours/week settings
- [ ] Separate main hours acquisition and backup acquisition into functions so
I can properly fall back on the backup when the user doesn't have the proper
data on their clipboard.
